# Maximum-Subarray-Sum-2D
Finding a contiguous subarray with the largest sum.

In computer science, the maximum subarray problem is the task of finding a contiguous subarray with the largest sum, within a given one-dimensional array A[1...n] of numbers.
This program was one of my programming methods class assignments.
It is the modification of classical MAXIMUM SUBARRAY SUM PROBLEM, by going to the secedn dimension.
